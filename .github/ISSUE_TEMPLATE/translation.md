If you know another language and want to help out, please follow these steps:
1. Create this issue and add details about which language you are adding. Make sure your language is listed in the table [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/i18n/#choosing-locales-to-support). If not, your language is not supported unfortunately üò¢
2. Make sure your language is not already in the [_locales](_locales) folder. If it is, we may have translations for your language already, but they might be out of date.
3. Download the [english messages file](_locales/en/messages.json) and translate each message into your language. The descriptions explain how each message is used in the extension, so these don't need to be translated.
4. Upload your translated messages file to this issue
5. Profit!

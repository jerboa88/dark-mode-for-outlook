A browser extension/add-on that applies a better (unofficial) dark mode to Microsoft Outlook and removes the ad sidebar. Available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera, and compatible with Firefox mobile!


## Installation
### Simple
The extension can be installed for your browser here:
| [![Chrome logo][chrome_logo]][chrome_link] | **[Chrome][chrome_link]** |
| - | - |
| [![Firefox logo][firefox_logo]][firefox_link] | **[Firefox][firefox_link]** |
| [![Edge logo][edge_logo]][edge_link] | **[Edge][edge_link]** |
| [![Opera logo][opera_logo]][opera_link] | **[Opera][opera_link]** |

**Note:** It can also be installed on [Brave](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017909112-How-can-I-add-extensions-to-Brave-), [Vivaldi](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/extensions/#install), and other Chromium-based browsers from the Chrome Web Store (or by sideloading).

**Note:** Installing add-ons for Firefox mobile is complicated at the moment, since Android's [new Geckoview-based browser](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/02/update-on-extension-support-in-the-new-firefox-for-android/) does not officially support all add-ons yet. If you still want to use this add-on on Firefox mobile, refer to [this page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-firefox-android#w_expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly) for more information.


### Detailed
If you wish to build yourself, `build.sh` is used to copy all files to the `build/` directory, compile SCSS to CSS, and zip the extension, but you can do these steps any other way you wish. Next, the build directory or zip file can be loaded into your browser of choice:
- [Instructions for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest)
- [Instructions for Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/)
- [Instructions for Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension#run-your-extension-locally-in-your-browser-while-developing-it-side-loading)
- [Instructions for Opera](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/)

**Note:** A command line version of [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) is required for compiling stylesheets.


## Usage
Just install the extension and you should be good to go! The extension does not have any other settings at the moment.

If you encounter any problems while using the extension, please create an issue [here](/issues), send me an email at extensions@johng.io, or create a pull request yourself to fix the issue.

I try to fix the extension as soon as possible when Outlook makes breaking changes, but keep in mind it may take some time for me to fit the work into my schedule and make all the changes that need to be made. Thanks for your patience :).
